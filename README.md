# NXAXi
### The following is required:
* The Arduino XInput Library (https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput)
* A Arduino board compatible with ArduinoXInput (in my case, a Arduino Leonardo)
* A Mayflash MAGIC-NS (https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-MAGIC-NS-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B074JZPS39)
### The following is optional:
* Another Arduino board to act as a master (in my case, a Arduino Mega 2560)

 Nintendo Switch AutoXInput (or NSAXI) is a set of Arduino files to "emulate" a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. This uses the XInput support of the Mayflash Magic-NS to output Nintendo Switch Pro Controller inputs, allowing automatic and nearly TAS-like inputs. TAS-*like* because this project is in **HEAVY** devolpment and is no where near production. There is spaghetti code. There is code that makes no sense. I am aware and am always accepting pull requests.
